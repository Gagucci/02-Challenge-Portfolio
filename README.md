# KG Portfolio

## Description 

The goal of this project was to employ CSS to create a portfolio website containing information about me, a showcase of projects I've worked on, and a section where you can contact me through various means. This was one of my first webpages that I created completely from scratch. It makes use of icons images for links, images that are linked to their respective applications, and a Nav bar with links that take you to each named section of the page.
